### 4. Meeting Summary

The weekly synchronization focused on progress updates for the website redesign and the status of the backend migration. The team confirmed that the website homepage design is nearly complete, pending final mobile responsiveness adjustments. The backend migration encountered a significant delay due to a database schema mismatch, necessitating a two-day timeline extension. The team formally approved a new server budget and ratified the updated launch date.

### 5. Key Discussion Points

*   **Website Redesign (Homepage):** Sarah confirmed the homepage is largely finished, requiring only final adjustments for the responsive mobile layout. Alex emphasized the need to test the layout on both iOS and Android platforms.
*   **Backend Migration Status:** Mike reported hitting a database schema conflict, requiring the development of a custom migration script to handle specific edge cases.
*   **Project Timeline Impact:** The required custom migration script resulted in a projected two-day delay to the project timeline.
*   **Server Provisioning:** Sarah requested approval for the budget for a new server instance, quoted at $50 per month.

### 6. Decisions Made

*   **Project Launch Date:** The official project launch date was moved from the planned Friday to **Next Monday (the 25th)**, to accommodate the backend migration delay.
*   **Budget Approval:** The request to approve **$50 per month** for the new server instance was formally approved by Alex.
